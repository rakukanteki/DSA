# DSA: 
Data Structure and Algorithms are the building blocks for a software application. Depending on the program we need to figure out the efficient data structure tools.

## Language used:
1. C++.
2. Python.

# Topics Covered:
1. Tree.
2. Linked List.
3. Array.
4. Graphs.
5. Hashing.

### Hash Table:
We use a key, on which we apply the HASH function. The Hash Function returns us the address of 
the bucket(collection of all the data accumulated). And using that address, we can get the element.
This way we can get O(1) complexity.
